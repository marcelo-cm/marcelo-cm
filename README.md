- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcelo-cm, I run Canada's largest undergraduate organization on AI – <a href="https://www.qmind.ca">QMIND</a> – and last summer spent my working as an AI Research Analyst & Software Developer, creating a product w/ Google PMs to help <a href="https://memoria.live/">combat mental health</a> & building <a href="https://callsmartai.ca/">AI-based Saas products in the medical field</a>. I'm self-taught, as most people are, thanks to Youtube, ChatGPT & my friends!
